Flutter project architecture template.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Freezed Example:
```dart
// This file is "main.dart"
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

// required: associates our `main.dart` with the code generated by Freezed
part 'main.freezed.dart';
// optional: Since our Person class is serializable, we must add this line.
// But if Person was not serializable, we could skip it.
part 'main.g.dart';

@freezed
class Person with _$Person {
  const factory Person({
    required String firstName,
    required String lastName,
    required int age,
  }) = _Person;

  factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json)
      => _$PersonFromJson(json);
}
```
